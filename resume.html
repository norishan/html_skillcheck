    <h1> Nori's Resume </h1>
    <p> This is my resume. I do my best to update it as often as possible. I unfortunately do not have internship experiences due to family financial circumstances in my early college career. However, I have soft skills as well as many vital technical skills to become a future reliable data scientist. You may download the resume by directly clicking on the picture. </p>
