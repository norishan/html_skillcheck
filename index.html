                <h2> About Me </h2>  
                    <p>I am a senior Economics student at Indiana University, specializing in Econometrics to understand the complexities of the world. 
                       I utilize programming tools like Python and R to delve deeper into this field and fuel my enthusiasm for mathematics and computer science. 
                       In my free time, I focus on enhancing my programming and machine learning skills, aspiring to become a data scientist. I also engage in personal projects and plan to showcase them soon. Balancing my commitments, 
                       I regularly travel between Fort Wayne and Bloomington to assist my non-English-speaking parents with their business. Alongside economics and data science, I have a deep appreciation for pottery, which holds a special place in my heart.</p>
