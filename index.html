                <h2> About Me </h2>  
                    <p>I am currently a senior pursuing a degree in Economics at Indiana University, where my focus lies in comprehending the intricacies of the world through the lens of Econometrics. To delve into this subject further, I employ various programming tools such as Python and R, fueling my growing enthusiasm for mathematics and computer science.
                        In my leisure time, I dedicate myself to furthering my proficiency in programming and machine learning, driven by my aspiration to become a data scientist. Additionally, I enjoy engaging in personal projects, some of which I plan to showcase here in the near future. Balancing my commitments, I regularly travel between Fort Wayne and Bloomington to assist my parents with their non-English-speaking business.
                        In addition to my passion for economics and data science, I have a deep appreciation for pottery, which holds a special place in my heart.</p>
