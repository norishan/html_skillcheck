                <h2> Hi! My name is Nori. </h2>
                    <p> Welcome to my website! I created this page as part of skill check 1 for I101 as well as for me to showcase any projects that I would like to share with curious minds like yours! <br> I plan to keep adding on to the web page as my skills and experiences continues to grow.</p>
                    <p> As you scroll deeper, you will find more info on my latest projects as well as links to <br> my LinkedIn and Instagram. I am way much active on both platforms more than I would like to so feel free to connect! </p>

                <h2> About Me </h2>  
                    <p> I am currently a senior studying Economics at Indiana University. My passion lies on understanding the world through the lenses of Econometrics <br> by using various programming tools such as python and R. From that, my interest continues to grow for math and computers. </p> 
                    <P> On my free time, I continue work on my programming and machine learning skills so I can pursue my dream of becoming a data scientist. <br> I also like to work on pet projects which I plan on adding here soon. Other than that, I switch between Fort Wayne and Bloomington to help <br> my parents out with their business as they do not speak english. Oh, I also love pottery just as much as econ and data science! </P>
